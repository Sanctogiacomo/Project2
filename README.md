## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
-SweetAlert
- Font-awesome
- JavaScript DOM


### What I learned


```html
I learnt a lot from from this project. I mean from structuring my project to the commenting of code... 

```
```css
Using  the media query was bombshell. To make my page responsive it took a great deal.
I was able to how to use flexbox, grid, and much more. Thanks to resources online!
```


### Continued development

Areas that I want to continue focusing on in future projects: I would love to work on the input interaction with the users. Example: When the user submits his/her email for subscription the user should get a response that email has been received.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me to understand the proper use of Js DOM. I really liked their examples and would definitely use it in my subsequent project.

- [Resource 2](https://stackoverflow.com/) - Stack Overflow is another place I got a lot of opinion about responsiveness of my webpage/Use of hamburger icon and I will definitely recommend it to anyone still learning and get stucked at any point.
